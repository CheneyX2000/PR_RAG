            Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that combines the power of large language models 
            with external knowledge retrieval. It works by first retrieving relevant documents from a knowledge base, 
            then using these documents as context for generating responses. This approach allows LLMs to access 
            up-to-date information and provide more accurate, grounded responses.
            
            The key components of a RAG system include:
            1. Document ingestion and preprocessing
            2. Embedding generation for semantic search
            3. Vector database for efficient similarity search
            4. Retrieval mechanism to find relevant documents

            PgVector is a PostgreSQL extension that adds support for vector similarity search. It enables storing

            Key features of PgVector:
            - Native PostgreSQL integration
            - Support for cosine, L2, and inner product distance metrics
            - Efficient indexing with HNSW and IVFFlat

            When building RAG systems in Python, following best practices ensures maintainability and performance:
            
            1. Use async/await for I/O operations to handle concurrent requests efficiently
            2. Implement proper error handling and retry mechanisms
            3. Use connection pooling for database connections
            4. Batch operations when processing multiple documents
            5. Implement caching for frequently accessed data
            6. Use type hints and Pydantic for data validation
